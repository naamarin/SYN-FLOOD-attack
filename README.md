There are malicious parties who try to perform Denial of Service using a SYN-FLOOD attack. The attack comes from a large number of IP addresses.
For this purpose, I wrote a Python script that identifies (given a pcapng file) the IP addresses of the attackers and saves them in a file called attack addresses.txt. (so that he will not serve them later)
